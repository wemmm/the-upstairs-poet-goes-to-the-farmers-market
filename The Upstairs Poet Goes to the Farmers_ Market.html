You live upstairs in a converted attic, where you like to write poetry and not talk to anybody for extended periods of time. 

You also like to play the bongos at roughly 2am every day.

You are such a great artiste!

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[I am!]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[I am sad anyway]]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="I am!" tags="" position="337,350" size="100,100">Yes you are!

Who cares what your neighbours downstairs think of you? They are philestines. 

In fact, you are so emboldened by how little you care about their opinions that you are willing to brave the communal stairwell in order to leave the house. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="I am sad anyway" tags="" position="486,350" size="100,100">You have a lot of things to be sad about despite the fact that you are an excellent poet.

For one thing, your downstairs neighbours do not seem to appreciate you at all.
